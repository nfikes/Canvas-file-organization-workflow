// Program Use: To organize massive amounts of files that follow a specific naming convention. Allows CAD and 3D systems to
//              properly load dependencies without loss of original filenames and filename redundancy.

//Some libries here are able to provide terminal commands to edit a directory the file is in, move files, change filenames.

// Useful information on how to use this small program to quickly organize thousands of Downloaded Canvas submissions //

// 1. Download all the submissions from the canvas page into a zip file.

// 2. Extract all submission files into any folder in any directory, make sure they are not inside a subfolder.
//    Check to make sure the submissions have the following format (the program will convert from the format below):

//    "[name]_[LATE]_123456_12345678_[OriginalFilename][-1 redundancy suffix].[extension]"
//     converts to:
//    "[OriginalFilename].[extension]"

//  Example dataset (Mixture of NX files and PDF):

//  david_LATE_226674_36384427_.25_.75Screw.prt                 ->  david [LATE]/.25_.75Screw.prt
//  john_203772_36359031_ThebikeAssembly-1.prt                  ->  john/ThebikeAssembly.prt
//  jack_LATE_199184_36332751_MyModel.pdf                       ->  jack [LATE]/MyModel.pdf
//  christina_LATE_201106_36357737_M3-0.5 Screw.STEP-1_stp.prt  ->  christina [LATE]/M3-0.5 Screw.STEP-1_stp.prt
//  julia_226171_36362062_Wedge_Pin-1.prt                       ->  julia/Wedge_Pin.prt
//  mary_198429_36345787_Finished Report.pdf                    ->  mary/Finished Report.pdf

// 3. Move the EXEC (for MAC) or EXE (for Windows) into the directory where you want to organize files. Double click it.

// 4. Observe the Terminal Output and then check the folder where the submissions are,
//    if there are no errors, all the submissions will have their Canvas download identifiers removed.
//    All organized files will have their original submitted names, their subdirectories will inherit
//    the name and LATE attribute designated by each file, and subdirectiories will prevent file
//    name redundancy in the system.
